# EasyHardware Frontend Heroku Build

This build works with heroku. Runs Gulp compilation and minification as you push into heroku. 

I had issues trying to push a foundation for site project to heroku while I was learning Sass. Turns out we just need to change a few things in package.json and we are good to go.
